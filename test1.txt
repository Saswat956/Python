Certainly, here's a reframed version of your request:

"I would like to bring to your attention the challenges I'm currently facing with my Windows laptop, which are impacting my work negatively:

Frequent sudden reboots causing data loss.
Reduced battery life (less than 2 hours).
Persistent overheating, leading to noisy fan and shutdowns during high-computational tasks.
I'm working in a Linux-based development environment on Disc2, and replicating it on Windows has been challenging. Switching to a MacBook, which is UNIX-based, would simplify local environment replication.

Given our primary work on AWS, migrating from Windows to AWS is time-consuming.

Despite multiple updates, both VS Code and other IDEs frequently hang.

I kindly request approval to switch to a MacBook, as it would significantly alleviate these issues and improve my productivity
